# TASK 1
# 1. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, 
# between 1500 and 2700 (both included).

# TASK 2
# 2. Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit.
# [ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ]
# Expected Output :
# 60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
# 45°F is 7 in Celsius


# TASK 3
# 3. Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9.
# Note : User is prompted to enter a guess. If the user guesses wrong then the prompt appears
#  again until the guess is correct, on successful guess,
#  user will get a "Well guessed!" message, and the program will exit.
