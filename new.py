# TASK 1

# Write a program which accepts a string as input to print "Yes" if the string is "yes", "YES" or "Yes", otherwise print "No". 
# Hint: Use input () to get the persons input

# TASK2
# Implement a function that takes as input three variables,
#  and returns the largest of the three. Do this 
# without using the Python max () function!
# The goal of this exercise is to think about some internals that
#  Python normally takes care of for us. 


# TASK3

# Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes
#  a new list of only the first and last
#  elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function


# TASK 4
# Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd,
#  print out an appropriate message to the user. 
# Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

# If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.


# TASK 5

# With a given tuple (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10),
#  write a program to print the first half values in one line and
#  the last half values in one line.
# sample output => 12345
#                  678910



# MILESTONE TASK 
# Create a class called Payroll whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary
#  by getting the inputs basic salary and benefits. Create 5 different class methods which will
#  calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, grossSalary and netSalary. 
# NB: Use KRA, NHIF and NSSF values provided in the link below.

# Task 6
# LIST METHODS
task_list = [23, 'Jane', ['Lesson 23', 560, {'currency' : 'KES'}], 987, (76,'John')]
# Determing type of variable in task_list using an inbuilt function


# Task 6a
# Print KES


# Task 6b
# Print 560


# Task 6c
# Use a function to determine the length of taksList

# Task 6d
# Change 987 to 789 without using an inbuilt -method or Assignment


# Task 6e
# Change the name “John” to “Jane” .


# Task 7
# Check for password length using if else conditional statements
# if less than 5 print too short
# if greater than 15 print too many characters
# if in between print login successful



# TASK8
# create a GRADING SYSTEM
# ask for students marks in five subjects
# calculate the average and grade them ABCD depending on their performance


# TASK9
# create a page to login to facebook
# have three variables for username, email and pasword
# let the user enter their username
# if true enter ask for their email email if true ask for their  password
# if invald respond 
# if any detail is wrong notify the user. proceed only if details are correct


# TASK 10
# BUY AIRTIME APPLICATION
# have users balance
# let them buy airtime if balance is okay
# ask them for the amount they want to spend and display their balance after transaction


# TASK 11
#ask for two numbers and print the greatest



# Task 12
# A student will not be allowed to sit in exam if his/her attendence is less than 75%.
# Take following input from user
# Number of classes held
# Number of classes attended.
# And print
# percentage of class attended
# Is student is allowed to sit in exam or not.


# TASK12 b
# 3.Modify the above question to allow student to sit if he/she has medical cause. 
# Ask user if he/she has medical cause or not ( 'Y' or 'N' ) and print accordingly.

# TASK 13
# 4.A shop will give discount of 10% if the cost of purchased quantity is more than 1000.
# Ask user for quantity
# Suppose, one unit will cost 100.
# Judge and print total cost for user.


# TASK 14
# Accept two int values from the user and return their product. 
# If the product is greater than 1000, then return their sum


# TASK 15
# Write a Python program to check if all dictionaries in a list are empty or not.

# Sample list : [{},{},{}]
# Return value : True
# Sample list : [{1,2},{},{}]
# Return value : False



# TASK 16
# Write a program that prints the numbers 1-100, each on a new line
# For each number that is a multiple of 3, print “Fizz” instead of the number
# For each number that is a multiple of 5, print “Buzz” instead of the number
# For each number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz” instead of the number
# if doesnt fall in any category print the number
# Now that you know what you need to write, you can get started!
name = input('What is your name:  ')
